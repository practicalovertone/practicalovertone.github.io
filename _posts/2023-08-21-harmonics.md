# Harmonics and overtones

Let's begin exploring harmonics with a simple AH vowel.

<div style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; width: 100%; padding-top: 5%">
    <audio controls style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;">
        <source src="/assets/00-harmonics/00_intro_ah.flac" type="audio/flac">
        Your browser does not support the audio tag.
    </audio>
</div>
<div style="margin-top: 10px;"> <!-- just a bit of space after the video --> </div>

To begin this exploration, we're going to use [VoceVista](https://www.vocevista.com/) to help
us visualize the audio from our above sample.

<div style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; width: 100%; padding-top: 56.25%;">
    <video controls style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;">
        <source src="/assets/00-harmonics/01_ah.mp4" type="video/mp4">
        Your browser does not support the video tag.
    </video>
</div>

A bit of orientation to the VoceVista window (as we'll be using it heavily) also known
as a [spectrogram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectrogram):

* On the X axis is time
* On the Y axis is the frequencies found in the audio
* The colors represent the volume of each frequency (blue for soft and red for loud)

Each of the horizontal lines is an individual note being produced in the audio!

VoceVista gives us the ability to filter frequencies. Let's use this filter to listen
to each note individually.

<div style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; width: 100%; padding-top: 56.25%;">
    <video controls style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;">
        <source src="/assets/00-harmonics/02_ah_individual_notes.mp4" type="video/mp4">
        Your browser does not support the video tag.
    </video>
</div>
<div style="margin-top: 10px;"> <!-- just a bit of space after the video --> </div>

Let's filter the sound again, but this time add the frequencies from high to low. Listen
in particularly to when you can perceive the original note.

<div style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; width: 100%; padding-top: 56.25%;">
    <video controls style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;">
        <source src="/assets/00-harmonics/03_adding_from_top.mp4" type="video/mp4">
        Your browser does not support the video tag.
    </video>
</div>
<div style="margin-top: 10px;"> <!-- just a bit of space after the video --> </div>

The original sound slowly turns from individual notes and collapses into a sound that 
we perceive as one note. In reality, there are potentially hundreds of individual notes that 
make up the note being sung.

#### We call these higher notes - harmonics

## Observation 

### Every note that we perceive is made up of dozens of individual notes which we call harmonics
