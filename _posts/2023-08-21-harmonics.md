# Harmonics and overtones

Let's begin exploring harmonics with a simple AH vowel.

<div style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; width: 100%; padding-top: 5%">
    <audio controls style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;">
        <source src="/assets/00-harmonics/00_intro_ah.flac" type="audio/flac">
        Your browser does not support the audio tag.
    </audio>
</div>

To begin this exploration, we're going to use [VoceVista](https://www.vocevista.com/) to help
us visualize the audio from our sample.

<div style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; width: 100%; padding-top: 56.25%;">
    <video controls style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;">
        <source src="/assets/00-harmonics/01_ah.mp4" type="video/mp4">
        Your browser does not support the video tag.
    </video>
</div>

A bit of orientation to the VoceVista window (as we'll be using it heavily) also known
as a [spectrogram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectrogram):

* On the X axis is time
* On the Y axis is all of the frequencies found in the audio
* The colors represent the volume of each frequency (blue for soft and red for loud)

Each of the horizontal lines is an individual note being produced in the audio!

Let's isolate each found note. VoceVista gives us the ability to filter very specific
frequencies.

<div style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; width: 100%; padding-top: 56.25%;">
    <video controls style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;">
        <source src="/assets/00-harmonics/02_ah_individual_notes.mp4" type="video/mp4">
