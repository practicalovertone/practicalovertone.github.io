# I Am Sitting In A Room - Alvin Lucier

Here is the last minute from [I Am Sitting In A Room](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAxHlLK3Oyk) 
by Alvin Lucier. Alvin spoke and recorded a single passage into a room. He then played back the 
same passage and recorded the recording. By repeating this numerous times, the approximation of the 
resonant frequencies of the room can be found.

Here is the last minute of the piece (when the resonant freqencies are most apparent). Notice 
that the resonant frequencies do not move and only increase and decrease in amplitude.

<div style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; width: 100%; padding-top: 56.25%;">
    <video controls style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;">

        Your browser does not support the video tag.
    </video>
</div>
<div style="margin-top: 10px;"> <!-- just a bit of space after the video --> </div>

By calculating the long-term average spectrum of the last minute, the most prevelent resonant
frequencies are:

* D4+50ct
* A3+25ct
* C4+4ct
* E5-6ct
* C5+38ct
